# lstm_pm_pytorch
implementation of LSTM Pose Machines with Pytorch

This is pytorch implement of [LSTM Pose Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06316.pdf)

please note that this model is used for my own datasets. But the architecture and training are very close to the original model, please feel free to use it for your own project.

I will update this repo recently.

## Prerequisites
* Python 2.7
* scipy
* sklearn
* pillow
* PyTorch 0.2
* torchvision 0.1.9

## Train
python lstm_pm_train.py
